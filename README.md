# 📊 Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling

## 🚀 Project Overview

The main goal is to optimize a large customer dataset to prepare it for predictive modeling.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛠️ Data Type Conversion**:
  - 🔄 Converted two-factor categorical columns to Booleans.
  - 🧮 Converted integer columns to 32-bit integers.
  - 🌡️ Converted float columns to 16-bit floats.
  - 🗂️ Converted nominal categorical columns to the category data type.
  - 📊 Created and managed ordered categorical data to reflect natural hierarchies.

- **🔍 Data Filtering**:
  - 🎯 Filtered the dataset to include only students with 10 or more years of experience at companies with at least 1000 employees, targeting experienced professionals for the model.

These steps resulted in a highly memory-efficient dataset, making it more suitable for predictive modeling and improving the overall performance of data processing tasks.
